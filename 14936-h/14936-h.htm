<h2>THE BIRTH OF THE PRINCE OF WALES.</h2>
<p class="cen">(<em>By the Observer&rsquo;s own
Correspondent.</em>)</p>
<p>It will be seen that we were not premature in announcing the
probability of the birth of a Prince of Wales; and though it was
impossible that any one should be able to speak with certainty, our
positive tone upon the occasion serves to show the exclusive nature
of all our intelligence. We are enabled now to state that the
Prince will immediately take, indeed he has already taken, the
title of <em>Prince of Wales</em>, which it is generally understood
he will enjoy&mdash;at least if a child so young can be said to
enjoy anything of the kind&mdash;until an event shall happen which
we hope will be postponed for a very protracted period. The Prince
of Wales, should he survive his mother, will ascend the throne; but
whether he will be George the Fifth, Albert the First, Henry the
Ninth, Charles the Third, or Anything the Nothingth, depends upon
circumstances we are not at liberty to allude to&mdash;<em>at
present</em>; nor do we think we shall be enabled to do so in a
second edition.</p>
<p>Our suggestion last week, that the royal birth should take place
on Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Day, has, we are happy to see, been partially
attended to; but we regret that the whole hog has not been gone, by
twins having been presented to the anxious nation, so that there
might have been a baronetcy each for the outgoing and incoming Lord
Mayors of Dublin and London. Perhaps, however, it might have been
attended with difficulty to follow our advice to the very letter;
but we nevertheless think it might have been arranged; though if
others think otherwise, we, of course, have nothing further to say
upon the matter alluded to.</p>
<p>We very much regret to make an announcement, and are glad at
being the first to do so, though we are sorry to advert to the
subject, touching an alarming symptom in the Princess Royal. Her
Royal Highness, ever since the birth of the Prince, whom we think
we may now venture to call her brother, has suffered from an
affection of the nose, which is said to be quite out of joint since
the royal stranger (for we hope we may take the liberty of alluding
to the Prince of Wales as a stranger, for he is a stranger to us,
at least we have never seen him) came into existence.</p>
<p>We hear it on good authority that when the Princess was taken to
see her brother, Her Royal Highness, who begins to articulate a few
sounds, exclaimed, &ldquo;<em>Tar</em>!&rdquo; with unusual
emphasis. It is supposed, from this simple but affecting
circumstance, that the Prince of Wales will eventually become <em>a
Tar</em>, and perhaps regain for his country the undisputed
dominion of the seas, which, by-the-bye, has not been questioned,
and probably will not be, in which case the naval attributes of His
Royal Highness will not be brought into activity.</p>
<hr />
<h3>FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.</h3>
<p>Master Smith took an airing on the 5th, accompanied by a Guy
Fawkes and a very numerous <em>suite</em>. In the evening there was
a select circle, and a bonfire.</p>
<p>Mr. Baron Nathan and family are still at Kennington. The Baron
danced the college hornpipe, last Wednesday, on one leg, before a
party of private friends; and the Honourable Miss Nathan went
through the Cracovienne, amidst twenty-four coffee-cups and an
inverted pitcher, surmounted by a very long champagne-glass. Upon
inspecting the cups after the graceful performance was concluded,
there was not a chip upon one of them. The champagne glass, though
it frequently rattled in its perilous position, retained it through
the whole of the dance, and was carefully picked up at its
conclusion by the Baroness, who we were happy to find looking in
more than her usual health, and enjoying her accustomed
spirits.</p>
<p>Bill Bunks has a new feline provisional equipage ready to
launch. The body is a dark black, and the wheels are of the same
rich colour, slightly picked out here and there with a chalk
stripe. The effect altogether is very light and pretty,
particularly as the skewers to be used are all new, and the board
upon which the <em>ha&rsquo;porths</em> are cut has been recently
planed with much nicety.</p>
<p>The travelling menagerie at the foot of Waterloo-bridge was
visited yesterday by several loungers. Amongst the noses poked
through the wires of the cage, we remarked several belonging to
children of the mobility. The spirited proprietor has added another
mouse to his collection, which may now be pronounced the
first&mdash;speaking, of course, Surreysideically&mdash;in
(entering) London.</p>
<hr />
<h3>SONGS FOR CATARRHS.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The variable climate of our native land,&rdquo; as
Rowland the Minstrel of Macassar has elegantly expressed it, like a
Roman epicure, deprives our nightingales of their tongues, and the
melodious denizens of our drawing-rooms of their &ldquo;sweet
voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vainly has Crevelli raised a bulwark of lozenges against the
Demon of Catarrh! Soreness will invade the throat, and noses run in
every family, seeming to be infected with a sentimental furor for
blooming&mdash;we presume from being so newly blown. We have seen
noses chiseled, as it were, from an alabaster block, grow in one
short day scarlet as our own, as though they blushed for the
continual trouble they were giving their proprietors; whilst the
peculiar intonation produced by the conversion of the nasals into
liquids, and then of the liquids ultimately into mutes, leads to
the inference that there must be a stoppage about the bridge, and
should be placarded, like that of Westminster, &ldquo;No
thoroughfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been generally supposed that St. Cecilia with a cold in
her head would be incompetent to &ldquo;Nix my Dolly;&rdquo; and
this erroneous and popular prejudice is continually made the excuse
for vocal inability during the winter months. Now the effect which
we have before described upon the articulation of the catarrhed
would be, in our opinion, so far from displeasing, that we feel it
would amply compensate for any imperfections of tune. For instance,
what can be finer than the alteration it would produce in the
well-known ballad of &ldquo;Oh no, we never mention
her!&rdquo;&mdash;a ballad which has almost become wearisome from
its sweetness and repetition. With a catarrh the words would run
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;O lo, we lever beltiol her,</p>
<p>Her labe is lever heard.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Struck with this modification of sound, PUNCH, anxious to cater
<em>even</em> for the catarrhs of his subscribers, begs to furnish
them with a &ldquo;<em>calzolet</em>,&rdquo; which he trusts will
be of more service to harmonic meetings than pectoral lozenges and
paregoric, as we have anticipated the cold by converting every
<em>m</em> into <em>b</em>, and every <em>n</em> into
<em>l</em>.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;POSSUM UP A GUM TREE!&rdquo;</h3>
<p>A grand gladiatorial tongue-threshing took place lately in a
field near Paisley, between the two great Chartist
champions&mdash;Feargus O&rsquo;Connor and the Rev. Mr. Brewster.
The subject debated was, Whether is moral or physical force the
fitter instrument for obtaining the Charter? The Doctor espoused
the moral hocussing system, and Feargus took up the bludgeon for
physical force. After a pretty considerable deal of fireworks had
been let off on both sides, it was agreed to divide the field, when
Feargus, waving his hat, <em>ascended into a tree</em>, and called
upon his friends to follow him. But, alas! few answered to the
summons,&mdash;he was left in a miserable minority; and the Doctor,
as the Yankees say, decidedly &ldquo;put the critter up a
tree.&rdquo; Feargus, being a <em>Radical</em>, should have kept to
the <em>root</em> instead of venturing into the higher
<em>branches</em> of political economy. At all events the Doctor,
as the Yankees say, &ldquo;put the critter up a tree,&rdquo; where
we calculate he must have looked tarnation ugly. The position was
peculiarly ill-chosen&mdash;for when a fire-and-faggot orator
begins to speak <em>trees-on</em>, it is only natural that his
hearers should all take their <em>leaves</em>!</p>
<hr />
<h3>AN UNDIVIDED MOIETY.</h3>
<p>The <em>Herald</em> gives an account of two persons who were
carried off suddenly at Lancaster by a paralytic attack
<em>each</em>. We should have been curious to know the result if,
instead of an attack <em>each</em>, they had had <em>one between
them</em>.</p>

<h2>THE HEIR OF APPLEBITE.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<h4>SHOWS THAT DOCTORS DIFFER.</h4>

"A large letter H with flowering vines twining it." id="img018-01"
name="img018-01" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hide">H</span>aving christened his child, Agamemnon
felt it to be his bounden duty to have him vaccinated; but his
wife&rsquo;s mother, with a perversity strongly characteristic of
the <em>genus</em>, strenuously opposed Dr. Jenner&rsquo;s plan of
repealing the small pox<sup>1</sup><span class="sidenote">1.
Baylis.</span>, and insisted upon having him inoculated. Poor Mrs.
Applebite was sorely perplexed between her habitual reverence for
the opinions of her mama and the dread which she naturally felt of
converting the face of the infant heir into a plum-pudding.
Agamemnon had evidently determined to be positive upon this point,
and all that could be extracted from him was the one
word&mdash;vaccination!</p>
<p>To which Mrs. Waddledot replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vaccination, indeed!&mdash;as though the child were a
calf! I&rsquo;m sure and certain that the extreme dulness of young
people of the present day is entirely owing to vaccination&mdash;it
imbues them with a very stupid portion of the animal
economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Agamemnon could not understand her, he again
ejaculated&mdash;&ldquo;Vaccination!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Applebite, &ldquo;Mama
has had so much experience that her opinion is worth listening to;
I know that you give the preference to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vaccination!&rdquo; interrupted Collumpsion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so do I; but we have heard of grown-up
people&mdash;who had always considered themselves
secure&mdash;taking the small pox, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure we have,&rdquo; chimed in Mrs. Waddledot;
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a very dreadful thing, after indulgent and
tender parents have been at the expense of nursing, clothing,
physicking, teaching music, dancing, Italian, French, geography,
drawing, and the use of the globes, to a child, to have it carried
off because a misguided fondness has insisted
upon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vaccination!&rdquo; shouted <em>pater</em>
Collumpsion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; continued the &ldquo;wife&rsquo;s
mother.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now inoculate at once, say I, before the
child&rsquo;s short-coated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agamemnon rose from his seat, and advancing deliberately and
solemnly to the table at which his wife and his wife&rsquo;s mother
were seated, he slowly raised his dexter arm above his head, and
then, having converted his hand into a fist, he dashed his
contracted digitals upon the rosewood as though he dared not trust
himself with more than one word, and that one
was&mdash;&ldquo;Vaccination!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Waddledot&rsquo;s first impulse was to jump out of her
turban, in which she would have succeeded had not the mystic rolls
of gauze which constituted that elaborate head-dress been securely
attached to the chestnut &ldquo;front&rdquo; with which she had
sought for some years to cheat the world into a forgetfulness of
her nativity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was warned of this! I was warned of this!&rdquo;
exclaimed the disarranged woman, as soon as she obtained breath
enough for utterance. &ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t believe it. I was
told that the member for Puddingbury had driven one wife to her
grave and the other to drinking.&mdash;I was told that it would run
in the family, and that Mr. <em>A.C.</em> Applebite would be no
better than Mr. I. Applebite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mama&mdash;you really wrong Aggy,&rdquo; exclaimed
Theresa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky for you that you think so, my dear. If
ever there was an ill-used woman, you are that unhappy individual.
Oh, that ever&mdash;I&mdash;should live&mdash;to see a child of
mine&mdash;have a child of hers vaccinated against her wish!&rdquo;
and here Mrs. Waddledot (as it is emphatically styled) burst into
tears; not that we mean to imply that she was converted into an
explosive <em>jet d&rsquo;eau</em>, but we mean that
she&mdash;she&mdash;what shall we say?&mdash;she blubbered.</p>
<p>It is really surprising how very sympathetic women are on all
occasions of weeping, scolding, and scandalising; and accordingly
Mrs. Applebite &ldquo;opened the fountains of her eyes,&rdquo; and
roared in concert with her mama.</p>
<p>Agamemnon felt that he was an injured man&mdash;injured in the
tenderest point&mdash;his character for connubial kindness; and he
secretly did what many husbands have done openly&mdash;he consigned
Mrs. Waddledot to the gentleman who is always represented as very
black, because where he resides there is no water to wash with.</p>
<p>At this agonising moment Uncle Peter made his appearance; and as
actors always play best to a good audience, the weeping ladies
continued their lachrymose performance with renewed vigour. Uncle
Peter was a plain man&mdash;plain in every meaning of the word;
that is to say, he was very ugly and very simple; and when we tell
you that his face resembled nothing but a half-toasted muffin, you
can picture to yourself what it must have looked like under the
influence of surprise; but nevertheless, both Agamemnon and the
ladies simultaneously determined to make him the arbitrator in this
very important matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Peter,&rdquo; said Agamemnon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Peter,&rdquo; sobbed Mrs. Waddledot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which are you an advocate for?&rdquo; hystericised Mrs.
Applebite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vaccination or inoculation?&rdquo; exclaimed everybody
<em>ensemble</em>.</p>
<p>Now whether Uncle John did clearly understand the drift of the
question put to him, or whether he conceived that he was solicited
to be the subject of some benevolent experiments for the advantage
of future generations, it is certain that no man ever looked more
positively</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/018-02.png"><img src=
"images/018-02.png" alt=

<p>ON THE HORN OF A DILEMMA</p>
</div>
<p>than Uncle Peter. At length the true state of the case was made
apparent to him; and the conclusion that he arrived at reflects the
greatest possible credit upon his judgment. He decided, that as the
child was a divided property, for the sake of peace and quietness,
the heir of Applebite should be vaccinated in one arm and
inoculated in the other.</p>
<hr />
<h3>FALSE ALARM.</h3>
<p>We were paralysed the other day at seeing a paragraph headed
&ldquo;Sibthorpe&rsquo;s conversion.&rdquo; Our nose grew pale with
terror; our hump heaved with agitation. We thought there existed a
greater genius than ourselves and that some one had discovered that
Sibthorp could be converted into anything but a Member for Lincoln,
and buffoon-in-waiting to the House of Commons. We found, however,
that it alluded to a Reverend, and not to OUR Colonel. Really the
newspaper people should be more careful. Such startling
announcements are little better than</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/018-03.png"><img src=
"images/018-03.png" alt="A jester cuts the tail off of a dog." id=

<p>SHEE(A)R CRUELTY.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<h3>DOING THE STATE SOME SERVICE.</h3>
<p>During the conflagration of the Tower, it was apprehended at one
time that the portion of it called the White Tower would have
shared the fate of the grand store-house,&mdash;this was however
prevented by hanging <em>wet blankets</em> around it, in which
capacity Peter Borthwick, Mr. Plumtre, Col. Percival, and Lord
Castlereagh, kindly offered their personal services and were found
admirably adapted for the purpose.</p>
<hr class="full" />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>[pg

<h2>THE GENTLEMAN&rsquo;S OWN BOOK.</h2>
<p>We will now proceed to the consideration of that indispensable
adjunct to a real gentleman&mdash;his purse. This little talisman,
though of so much real importance, is very limited in the materials
of its formation, being confined exclusively to silk. It should
generally be of net work, very sparingly powdered with small beads,
and of the most delicate colours, such conveying the idea that the
fairy fingers of some beauteous friend had wove the tiny treasury.
We have seen some of party colours, intended thereby to distinguish
the separate depository of the gold and silver coin with which it
is (presumed) to be stored. This arrangement we repudiate; for a
true gentleman should always appear indifferent to the value of
money, and affect at least an equal contempt for a sovereign as a
shilling. We prefer having the meshes of the purse rather large
than otherwise, as whenever it is necessary&mdash;mind, we say
necessary&mdash;to exhibit it, the glittering contents shining
through the interstices are never an unpleasing object of
contemplation.</p>
<p>The purse should be used at the card-table; but never produced
unless you are called upon as a loser to <em>pay</em>. It may then
be resorted to with an air of <em>nonchalance;</em> and when the
demand upon it has been honoured, it should be thrown carelessly
upon the table, as though to indicate your <em>almost</em> anxiety
to make a further sacrifice of its contents. Should you, however,
be a winner, any exhibition of the purse might be construed into an
unseemly desire of &ldquo;welling,&rdquo; or securing your gains,
which of course must always be a matter of perfect indifference to
you; and whatever advantages you obtain from chance or skill should
be made obvious to every one are only destined to enrich your
valet, or be beneficially expended in the refreshment of cabmen and
ladies of faded virtue. In order to convey these intentions more
conspicuously, should the result of an evening be in your favour,
your winnings should be consigned to your waistcoat pocket; and if
you have any particular desire to heighten the effect, a piece of
moderate value may be left on the table.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/018-04.png"><img src=
"images/018-04.png" alt=
"A horse throws a man into the roof of a house." id="img018-04"
name="img018-04" width="80%" /></a>
<p>A GENTLEMAN TAKING A FIRST FLOOR</p>
</div>
<p>cannot do better than find an excuse for a recurrence to his
purse; and then the partial exhibition of the coin alluded to above
will be found to be productive of a feeling most decidedly
confirmatory in the mind of the landlady that you are a true
gentleman.</p>
<p>The same cause will produce the same effect with a tradesman
whose album&mdash;we beg pardon, whose ledger&mdash;you intend
honouring with your name.</p>
<p>You should never display your purse to a poor friend or
dependant, or the sight of it might not only stimulate their
cupidity, or raise their expectations to an inordinate height, but
prevent you from escaping with a moderate <em>douceur</em> by
&ldquo;the kind manner in which you slipped a sovereign into their
hand at parting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A servant should never be rewarded from a purse; it makes the
fellows discontented; for if they see gold, they are never
satisfied with a shilling and &ldquo;I must see what can be done
for you, James.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Should you be fortunate enough to break a policeman&rsquo;s
head, or drive over an old woman, you will find that your purse
will not only add to the <em>&eacute;clat</em> of the transaction,
but most materially assist the magistrate before whom you may be
taken in determining that the case is very trifling, and that a
fine of 5s. will amply excuse you from the effects of that polite
epidemic known <em>vulgo</em> as drunkenness. There cannot be a
greater proof of the advantages of a purse than the preceding
instance, for we have known numerous cases in which the symptoms
have been precisely the same, but the treatment diametrically
opposite, owing to the absence of that incontrovertible evidence to
character&mdash;the purse.</p>
<p>None but a <em>parvenu</em> would carry his money loose; and we

<h2>THE O&rsquo;CONNELL PAPERS.</h2>
<h4>OUR EXTRAORDINARY AND EXCLUSIVE CORRESPONDENCE.</h4>
<p>We have been favoured by the transmission of the following
singular correspondence by the new Mayor of Dublin&rsquo;s private
secretary. We hasten to lay the interesting documents before our
readers, though we must decline incurring the extreme
responsibility of advising which offer it would be most
advantageous for Mr. O&rsquo;Connell to accept.</p>
<h4>LETTER I.</h4>
<p>SIR,&mdash;I am requested by the management of the Royal Surrey
Theatre to negotiate with you for a few nights&rsquo; performance
in a local drama, which shall be written for the occasion, and in
which you are requested to represent the Civic dignitary in the
identical robes which have become immortalised by your wearing. Mr.
Dibdin Pitt is of opinion that something might be done with
&ldquo;Whittington and his Cat,&rdquo; merely transferring the
scene from London to Dublin; and, as he hears your county is highly
celebrated for the peculiar breed, sending to Ireland for one of
the esteemed &ldquo;Kilkenny species,&rdquo; which would give a
greater reality to the <em>dramatis person&aelig;</em> and feline
adjunct. This is a mere suggestion, as any other subject you may
prefer&mdash;such as the Rebellion of &rsquo;98, Donnybrook Fair,
the Interior of the Irish Mansion House, or the House of Commons,
can be rendered equally effective. I beg to call your attention to
the fact that you shall have a clear stage and every advantage, as
Mr. N.T. Hicks will be left out of the cast altogether, or else
play a very small dumb villain; so that you need not fear losing
your oratorical reputation by being out-shouted. Should you feel
disposed to accept the terms, one clear half the nightly receipt,
pray forward an answer by return, that we may get out a woodcut of
the small-clothes, and underline the identical stockings.</p>
<p class="rgt">I have the honour to be,<br />
Your obedient servant,<br />

<p class="rgt"><em>T. R. D. L.</em></p>
<p>SIR,&mdash;The intense interest created in the bosoms of mankind
in general by the graphic account of your splendid appearance and
astounding performance of the arduous character of the Lord Mayor
of Dublin, induces Mr. W.C. Macready to make you an offer of
engagement for the performance of Shakspere&rsquo;s heroic
functionary in the forthcoming revival of Richard the Third, which
is about to be produced under his classic management at the Theatre
Royal Drury-lane, Mr. W.C. Macready offers to replace the breeches
if cracked in stooping; also, to guarantee a liberal allowance of
hair-powder to fall from the wig, and make the usual effective and
dignified huge point while the Mayor is bowing to the king. An
early answer will oblige your obedient servant,</p>

<p>DEAR DAN,&mdash;The Adelphi is open to you and your robes.
Couldn&rsquo;t we do something with a hero from Blarney, and let
you be discovered licking the stone, amid tableaux, blue fire, and
myriads of nymph-like Kate Kearneys? Or would you prefer an
allegory, yourself a Merman, or the Genius of Ireland, distributing
real whiskey-and-water from the tank, which shall be filled with
grog for that purpose. Think it over.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster presents his compliments to Daniel O&rsquo;Connell,
Esq., Mayor and M.P., and begs to suggest, as the &ldquo;Rent
Day&rdquo; was originally produced at his theatre, it will be an
excellent field for any further dramatic attempt of Mr. D.

to engage you to appear in costume, in the Mayor of Garratt, or,
for the sake of the name Mayor, any other Mayor you like. If you
think all the old ones too stupid, we can look upon something new,
and preserve the title. You shall be supported by Miss Vincent and

have your own silk tights, the latter department might suit you
best. Our artist is considered very great, and shall convert our

<h3>A P&AElig;AN FOR DAN.</h3>
<h4>BY ONE OF THE &ldquo;FINEST PISANTRY IN THE WORLD.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>We have received the following genuine &ldquo;Irish
version&rdquo; of a scene from and for the times, from our own
peculiar and poetic correspondent:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">&ldquo;DEAR PUNCH,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i8">I beg pardon that yoursilf I&rsquo;m now
troublin,</p>
<p>But I must let you know what I just seen in Dublin;</p>
<p>There Daniel O&rsquo;Connell,&mdash;Mayor and great
agitator,&mdash;</p>
<p>Has been making a Judy of himself, the poor unhappy cratur.</p>
<p>At his time of life, too! tare and ounds its mighty
shocking!</p>
<p>He shoved ach of his big legs into a span bran new silk
stocking:</p>
<p>How the divil them calves by any manes was thrust in,</p>
<p>Is a mistery to ev&rsquo;ry one, without them black silks
busting.</p>
<p>And instead of a dacent trousers hanging to his suspenders,</p>
<p>He has button&rsquo;d-up one-half of him in a pair of short
knee-enders.</p>
<p>Now, Punch, on your oath, did you ever hear the likes o&rsquo;
that?</p>
<p>But oh, houly Paul, if you only seen his big cock&rsquo;d
hat,</p>
<p>Stuck up on the top of his jazy;&mdash;a mighty illegant
thatch,</p>
<p>With hair like young Deaf Burke&rsquo;s, all rushing up to the
scratch,</p>
<p>You must have been divarted; and, Jewil, then he wore</p>
<p>A thund&rsquo;ring big Taglioni-cut purple velvet
<em>roquelore</em>.</p>
<p>And who but Misther Dan cut it fat in all his pride,</p>
<p>Cover&rsquo;d over with white favors, like a gentle blushing
bride;</p>
<p>And wasn&rsquo;t he follow&rsquo;d by all the blackguards for
his tail,</p>
<p>Shouting out for their lives, &lsquo;Success to Dan
O&rsquo;Connell and Rapale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the Old Corporation has behaved mighty low and mane,</p>
<p>As they wouldn&rsquo;t lend him the loan of the ancient raal
goold chain,</p>
<p>Nor the collar; as they said they thought (divil burn
&rsquo;em),</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;d done so, it was probable Dan never would return
&rsquo;em.</p>

<p>Whilst the air hath been fill&rsquo;d since eleven

<p class="i2">With the shouts of little boys;</p>
<p>And we have taken our little bell,</p>

<h3>A CON-CONSTITUTIONAL.</h3>
<p>Why is the little Prince of Wales like the 11th
Hussars?&mdash;Because it is Prince Albert&rsquo;s own.</p>
<hr />
<h3>HARD TO REMEMBER.</h3>
<p>Lord Monteagle, on being shown one of the Exchequer Bills,
supposed to have been forged, declared that he did not know if the
signature attached to it was his handwriting or not. We do not feel
surprised at this&mdash;his Lordship has put his hand to so many
jobs that it would be impossible he could remember every one of
them.</p>
<hr class="full" />
<h2>THE CROPS.</h2>
<p>A most unfounded report of the approaching demise of Colonel
Sibthorp reached town early last week. Our Leicester correspondent
has, however, furnished us with the following correct particulars,
which will be read with pleasure by those interested in the
luxuriant state of the gallant orator&rsquo;s crops. The truth is,
he was seen to enter a hair-dresser&rsquo;s shop, and it got about
amongst the breathless crowd which soon collected, that the
imposing <em>toup&eacute;e</em>, the enchanting whiskers that are
the pride of the county, were to be cropped! This mistake was
unhappily removed to give place to a more fatal one; for instead of
submitting to the shears, the venerable joker bought a paper of
<em>poudre unique</em>, from which arose the appalling report that
he was about to <em>dye</em>!</p>
<p>Our kind friend the indefatigable &ldquo;correspondent&rdquo; of
the <em>Observer</em>, informs us from authority upon which every
reliance may be placed, that Mr. Grant, the indefatigable statist
and author of &ldquo;Lights and Shadows of London Life,&rdquo; is
now patiently engaged in researches of overwhelming importance to
the public. He will, in his next edition of the above-named work,
be enabled to state from personal inquiry, how many ladies residing
within a circuit of ten miles round London wear false fronts, with
the colours respectively of their real and their artificial hair,
together with the number of times per year the latter are dressed.
Besides this, this untiring author has called at every
hairdresser&rsquo;s in the London Directory, to ascertain the
number of times per quarter each customer has his hair cut, with
the quantity and length denuded. From these materials a result will
be drawn up, showing the average duration of crops; and also how
far the hair-cuttings of every day in London would reach, if each
hair were joined together and placed somewhere, so as to
go&mdash;when enough is collected&mdash;round the world.</p>
<p>The <em>Morning Herald</em> of Monday informs us, that the King
of Hanover has passed a law to regulate the crops not only of the
army, but of those in the civil employ of government. The
moustaches of the former are to be, we hear, exact copies of those
sported by Muntz. The hair is to be cut close, so as to be woven
into regulation whiskers for those to whom nature has denied them.
The pattern whisker was lately submitted by Mr. Truefit, who is to
be the army contractor for the same. It curls over the cheek, and
meets the moustaches at the corners of the mouth.</p>
<p>In consequence of this measure, large sales in bear&rsquo;s
grease were made by the Russian merchants on &lsquo;Change
yesterday for the German markets. A consequent rise in this species
of manure took place; this will, it is feared, have a bad effect
upon the British crops, which have already assumed a dry and
languid appearance.</p>
<hr />
<h3>ELIGIBLE INVESTMENTS!&mdash;SPLENDID
OPPORTUNITY!&mdash;UNRIVALLED BARGAINS!</h3>
<h4>EXTRAORDINARY SALE OF UNREDEEMED PLEDGES.</h4>
<p>MESSRS. MACHIN and DEBENHAM respectfully inform the particularly
curious, and the public in general, they have the honor to announce
the unreserved sale of the following particularly and
unprecedentedly attractive Unredeemed Pledges.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;The auction duty to be paid by the
purchasers,&mdash;if not, the inmates of St. Luke&rsquo;s have
offered to subscribe for their liquidation.</p>
<h4>LOT I.</h4>
<p>A perfect collection of the original speeches of Sir Francis
Burdett&mdash;previous to his visit to the Tower; his fulminations
issued from the same; and a catalogue of the <em>unredeemed</em>
pledges made to the electors of Westminster, and originally taken
in by them&mdash;a compliment very handsomely returned by the
honourable Baronet, who kindly took his constituents in in return.
Very curious, though much dogs-eared, thumbed, and as far as the
author&rsquo;s name goes, totally erased.</p>
<h4>LOT II.</h4>
<p>A visionary pedigree and imaginative genealogical account of
Roebuck&rsquo;s ancestors&mdash;commencing in the year 1801, and
carefully brought down to the present time. Very elaborate, but
rather doubtful.</p>
<h4>LOT III.</h4>
<p>A full account of Wakley&rsquo;s parliamentary ratting, or
political felo-de-se; beautifully authenticated by his late
Finsbury electors&mdash;with sundry cuts by his former friends.</p>
<h4>LOT IV.</h4>
<p>An extraordinary large batch of uncommonly cheap bread,
manufactured by one John Russell. A beautiful electioneering and
imaginative production, though now rather stale.</p>
<h4>LOT V.</h4>
<p>A future contract for the continuance of the poor-laws, and the
right of pumps for the guardians to concoct the soup.</p>
<p>N.B. Filters used if too strong.</p>
<h4>LOT VI.</h4>
<p>Daniel O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s opinions upon the repeal of the
union, now that he is Lord Mayor of Dublin: to be sold without
reserve to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>The whole of the above are submitted to the public, in the
sincere hope of their meeting purchasers&mdash;as the price is all
that is wanting to ensure a <em>bon&acirc; fide</em> sale. No
catalogues&mdash;no particulars&mdash;no guarantees&mdash;no
deductions&mdash;and no money returned.</p>

<h2>SIR PETER LAURIE ON HUMAN LIFE.</h2>
<p>Sir PETER LAURIE has set his awful face against suicide! He will
in no way &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; <em>felo-de-se</em>. Fatal as
this aldermanic determination may be to the interests of the
shareholders of Waterloo, Vauxhall, and Southwark Bridges, Sir
PETER has resolved that no man&mdash;not even in the suicidal
season of November&mdash;shall drown, hang, or otherwise destroy
himself, under any pretence soever! Sir PETER, with a very proper
admiration of the pleasures of life, philosophises with a full
stomach on the ignorance and wickedness of empty-bellied humanity;
and Mr. HOBLER&mdash;albeit in the present case the word is not
reported&mdash;doubtless cried &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; to the wisdom of
the alderman. Sir PETER henceforth stands sentinel at the gate of
death, and any hungry pauper who shall recklessly attempt to touch
the knocker, will be sentenced to &ldquo;the treadmill for a month
as a rogue and vagabond!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One <em>William Simmons</em>, a starving tailor, in a perishing
condition, attempts to cut his throat. He inflicts upon himself a
wound which, &ldquo;under the immediate assistance of the surgeon
of the Compter,&rdquo; is soon healed; and the offender being
convalescent, is doomed to undergo the cutting wisdom of Sir PETER
LAURIE. Hear the alderman &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know <em>that that
sort</em> of murder (suicide) <em>is as bad as any
other?</em>&rdquo; If such be the case&mdash;and we would as soon
doubt the testimony of Balaam&rsquo;s quadruped as Sir
PETER&mdash;we can only say, that the law has most shamefully
neglected to provide a sufficing punishment for the enormity. Sir
PETER speaks with the humility of true wisdom, or he would never
have valued his own throat for instance&mdash;that throat enriched
by rivulets of turtle soup, by streams of city wine and city
gravies&mdash;at no more than the throat of a hungry tailor. There
never in our opinion was a greater discrepancy of windpipe. Sir
PETER&rsquo;S throat is the organ of wisdom&mdash;whilst the
tailor&rsquo;s throat, by the very fact of his utter want of food,
is to him an annoying superfluity. And yet, says Sir PETER by
inference, &ldquo;It is <em>as bad</em>, William Simmons, to cut
your own throat, as to cut mine!&rdquo; If true Modesty have left
other public bodies, certainly she is to be found in the court of
aldermen.</p>
<p>Sir PETER proceeds to discourse of the mysteries of life and
death in a manner that shows that the executions of his shrievalty
were not lost upon his comprehensive spirit. Suicides, however,
have engaged his special consideration; for he says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Suicides and attempts, or apparent attempts, to commit
suicide, very much increase, I regret to say. <em>I know that a
morbid humanity exists</em>, and does much mischief as regards the
practice. <em>I shall not encourage attempts of the kind</em>, but
shall punish them; and I sentence you to the treadmill for a month,
as a rogue and vagabond. I shall look <em>very narrowly at the
cases</em> of persons brought before me on such charges.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir PETER has, very justly, no compassion for the famishing
wretch stung and goaded &ldquo;to jump the life to come.&rdquo; Why
should he? Sir PETER is of that happy class of men who have found
this life too good a thing to leave. &ldquo;They call this world a
bad world,&rdquo; says ROTHSCHILD on a certain occasion; &ldquo;for
my part, I do not know of a better.&rdquo; And ROTHSCHILD was even
a greater authority than Sir PETER LAURIE on the paradise of
<em>&pound; s. d.</em></p>
<p>The vice of the day&mdash;&ldquo;a morbid humanity&rdquo;
towards the would-be suicide&mdash;is, happily, doomed. Sir PETER
LAURIE refuses to patronise any effort at self-slaughter; and,
moreover, threatens to &ldquo;look very narrowly at the
cases&rdquo; of those despairing fools who may be caught in the
attempt. It would here be well for Sir PETER to inform the suicidal
part of the public what amount of desperation is likely to satisfy
him as to the genuineness of the misery suffered. <em>William
Simmons</em> cuts a gash in his throat; the Alderman is not
satisfied with this, but having looked very narrowly into the
wound, declares it to be a proper case for the treadmill. We can
well believe that an impostor trading on the morbid humanity of the
times&mdash;and there is a greater stroke of business done in the
article than even the sagacity of a LAURIE can imagine&mdash;may,
in this cold weather, venture an immersion in the Thames or
Serpentine, making the plunge with a declaratory scream, the better
to extract practical compassion from the pockets of a morbidly
humane society; we can believe this, Sir PETER, and feel no more
for the trickster than if our heart were made of the best contract
saddle-leather; but we confess a cut-throat staggers us; we fear,
with all our caution, we should be converted to a belief in misery
by a gash near the windpipe. Sir PETER, however, with his enlarged
mind, professes himself determined to probe the wound&mdash;to look
narrowly into its depth, breadth, and length, and to prescribe the
treadmill, according to the condition of the patient! Had the
cautious Sir PETER been in the kilt of his countryman
<em>Macbeth</em>, he would never have exhibited an &ldquo;admired
disorder&rdquo; on the appearance of <em>Banquo</em> with his
larynx severed in two; not he&mdash;he would have called the wound
a slight scratch, having narrowly looked into it, and immediately
ordered the ghost to the guard-house.</p>
<p>The Duke of WELLINGTON, who has probably seen as many wounds as
Sir PETER LAURIE, judging the case, would, by his own admission,
have inflicted the same sentence upon the tailor <em>Simmons</em>
as that fulminated by the Alderman. ARTHUR and PETER would,
doubtless, have been of one accord, <em>Simmons</em> avowed himself
to be starving. Now, in this happy land&mdash;in this better
Arcadia&mdash;every man who wants food is proved by such want an
idler or a drunkard. The victor of Waterloo&mdash;the tutelary
wisdom of England&rsquo;s counsels&mdash;has, in the solemnity of
his Parliamentary authority, declared as much. Therefore it is most
right that the lazy, profligate tailor, with a scar in his throat,
should mount the revolving wheel for one month, to meditate upon
the wisdom of Dukes and the judgments of Aldermen!</p>
<p>We no more thought of dedicating a whole page to one Sir PETER
LAURIE, than the zoological Mr. CROSS would think of devoting an
acre of his gardens to one ass, simply because it happened to be
the largest known specimen of the species. But, without knowing it,
Sir PETER has given a fine illustration of the besetting
selfishness of the times. Had LAURIE been born to hide his ears in
a coronet, he could not have more strongly displayed the social
insensibility of the day. The prosperous saddler, and the wretched,
woe-begone tailor, are admirable types of the giant arrogance that
dominates&mdash;of the misery that suffers.</p>
<p>There is nothing more talked of with less consideration of its
meaning and relative value than&mdash;Life. Has it not a thousand
different definitions? Is it the same thing to two different
men?</p>
<p>Ask the man of independent wealth and sound body to paint Life,
and what a very pretty picture he will lay before you. He lives in
another world&mdash;has, as <em>Sir Anthony Absolute</em> says, a
sun and moon of his own&mdash;a realm of fairies, with attending
sprites to perform his every compassable wish. To him life is a
most musical monosyllable; making his heart dance, and thrilling
every nerve with its so-potent harmony. Life&mdash;but especially
his life&mdash;is, indeed, a sacred thing to him; and loud and deep
are his praises of its miracles. Like the departed ROTHSCHILD,
&ldquo;he does not know a better;&rdquo; certain we are, he is in
no indecent haste to seek it.</p>
<p>Demand of the prosperous man of trade&mdash;of the man of funds,
and houses, and land, acquired by successful projects&mdash;what is
Life? He will try to call up a philosophic look, and passing his
chin through his hand&mdash;(there is a brilliant on his little
finger worth at least fifty guineas)&mdash;he will answer,
&ldquo;Life, sir&mdash;Life has its ups and downs; but taken
altogether, for my part, I think a man a great sinner, a very great
sinner, who doesn&rsquo;t look upon life as a very pretty thing.
But don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk of such dry stuff&mdash;take off
your glass&mdash;hang it!&mdash;no heel-taps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ask another, whose whole soul, like a Ready Reckoner, is
composed of figures,&mdash;what is Life? He, perhaps, will answer,
&ldquo;Why, sir, Life&mdash;if you insure at our office&mdash;is
worth more than at any other establishment. We divide profits, and
the rate of insurance decreases in proportion,&rdquo; &amp;c.
&amp;c.; and thus you will have Life valued, by the man who sees
nothing in it but a privilege to get money, as the merest article
of commercial stock.</p>
<p>Inquire of many an Alderman what is Life? He will tell you that
it is a fine, dignified, full-bellied, purple-faced creature, in a
furred and violet-coloured gown. &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; he will say,
&ldquo;always has its pleasures; but its day of great delight is
the Ninth of November. Life, however, is especially agreeable in
swan-hopping season, when white-bait abounds at Blackwall and
Greenwich, and when the Lord Mayor gives his Easter-ball; and
&lsquo;keeps up the hospitalities of his high office.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Not, however, that life is without its graver duties&mdash;its
religious observations. Oh, no! it is the duty of well-to-do Life
to punish starving men for forgetting its surpassing
loveliness&mdash;it is a high obligation of Life to go to church in
a carriage, and confess itself a miserable sinner&mdash;it is the
duty of Life to read its bible; and then the Alderman, to show that
he is well versed in the volume, quotes a passage&mdash;&ldquo;when
the voice of the turtle is heard in the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now ask the Paisley weaver what is Life? Bid the famine-stricken
multitudes of Bolton to describe with their white lips the
surpassing beauty of human existence. Can it be possible that the
glorious presence&mdash;the beneficent genius that casts its
blessings in the paths of other men&mdash;is such an ogre, a fiend,
to the poor? Alas! is he not a daily tyrant, scourging with meanest
wants&mdash;a creature that, with all its bounty to others, is to
the poor and destitute more terrible than Death? Let Comfort paint
a portrait of Life, and now Penury take the pencil. &ldquo;Pooh!
pooh!&rdquo; cry the sage LAURIES of the world, looking at the two
pictures&mdash;&ldquo;that scoundrel Penury has drawn an infamous
libel. <em>That</em> Life! with that withered face, sunken eye, and
shrivelled lip; and what is worse, with a suicidal scar in its
throat! <em>That</em> Life! The painter Penury is committed for a
month as a rogue and vagabond. We shall look very narrowly into
these cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We agree with the profound Sir PETER LAURIE that it is a most
wicked, a most foolish act of the poor man to end his misery by
suicide. But we think there is a better remedy for such desperation
than the tread-mill. The surest way for the rich and powerful of
the world to make the poor man more careful of his life is to
render it of greater value to him.</p>

<h2>THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON MEDICAL STUDENT.</h2>
<h3>7.&mdash;OF VARIOUS OTHER DIVERTING MATTERS CONNECTED WITH
GRINDING.</h3>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/018-10.png"><img src=
"images/018-10.png" alt="A man carrying a load forms a letter F."
id="img018-10" name="img018-10" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hide">F</span>rom experience we are aware that the
invention of the useful species of phrenotypics, alluded to in our
last chapter, does not rest with the grinder alone. We once knew a
medical student (and many even now at the London hospitals will
recollect his name without mentioning it), who, when he was
grinding for the Hall, being naturally of a melodious and harmonic
disposition, conceived the idea of learning the whole of his
practice of physic by setting a description of the diseases to
music. He had a song of some hundred and twenty verses, which he
called &ldquo;The Poetry of Steggall&rsquo;s Manual;&rdquo; and
this he put to the tune of the &ldquo;Good Old Days of Adam and
Eve.&rdquo; We deeply lament that we cannot produce the whole of
this lyrical pathological curiosity. Two verses, however, linger on
our memory, and these we have written down, requesting that they
may be said or sung to the air above-mentioned, and dedicating them
to the gentlemen who are going up next Thursday evening. They
relate to the symptoms, treatment, and causes of H&aelig;moptysis
and H&aelig;matemesis; which terms respectively imply, for the
benefit of the million unprofessional readers who weekly gasp for
our fresh number, a spitting of blood from the lungs and a vomiting
of ditto from the stomach. The song was composed of stanzas similar
to those which follow, except the portion relating to <em>Diseases
of the Brain</em>, which was more appropriately separated into the
old English division of <em>Fyttes</em>.</p>
<h4>H&AElig;MOPTYSIS.</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>A sensation of weight and oppression at the chest, sirs;</p>
<p>With tickling at the larynx, which scarcely gives you rest,
sirs;</p>
<p>Full hard pulse, salt taste, and tongue very white, sirs;</p>
<p>And blood brought up in coughing, of colour very bright,
sirs.</p>
<p>It depends on causes three&mdash;the first&rsquo;s
exhalation;</p>
<p>The next a ruptured artery&mdash;the third, ulceration.</p>
<p>In treatment we may bleed, keep the patient cool and quiet,</p>
<p>Acid drinks, digitalis, and attend to a mild diet.</p>
<p class="i6">Sing hey, sing ho, we do not grieve</p>
<p class="i6">When this formidable illness takes its leave.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4>H&AElig;MATEMESIS.</h4>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Clotted blood is thrown up, in colour very black, sirs,</p>
<p>And generally sudden, as it comes up in a crack, sirs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s preceded at the stomach by a weighty sensation;</p>
<p>But nothing appears ruptured upon examination.</p>
<p>It differs from the last, by the particles thrown off, sirs,</p>
<p>Being denser, deeper-coloured, and without a bit of cough,
sirs.</p>
<p>In plethoric habits bleed, and some acid draughts pour in,
gents,</p>
<p>With Oleum Terebinthin&aelig; (small doses) and astringents.</p>
<p class="i6">Sing hey, sing ho; if you think the lesion
spacious,</p>
<p class="i6">The Acetate of Lead is found very efficacious.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thus, in a few lines a great deal of valuable professional
information is conveyed, at the same time that the tedium of much
study is relieved by the harmony. If poetry is yet to be found in
our hospitals&mdash;a queer place certainly for her to dwell,
unless in her present feeble state the frequenters of Parnassus
have subscribed to give her an in-patient&rsquo;s ticket&mdash;we
trust that some able hand will continue this subject for the
benefit of medical students generally; for, we repeat, it is much
to be regretted that no more of this valuable production remains to
us than the portion which Punch has just immortalized, and set
forth as an apt example for cheering the pursuit of knowledge under
difficulties. The gifted hand who arranged this might have turned
Cooper&rsquo;s First Lines of Surgery into a tragedy; Dr.
Copeland&rsquo;s Medical Dictionary into a domestic melodrama, with
long intervals between the acts; and the Pharmacopoeia into a light
one-act farce. It strikes us if the theatres could enter into an
arrangement with the Borough Hospitals to supply an amputation
every evening as the finishing <em>coup</em> to an act, it would
draw immensely when other means failed to attract.</p>
<p>The last time we heard this poem was at an harmonic meeting of
medical students, within twenty shells&rsquo; length of the
&mdash;&mdash; School dissecting-room. It was truly delightful to
see these young men snatching a few Anacreontic hours from their
harassing professional occupations. At the time we heard it, the
singer was slightly overcome by excitement and tight boots; and, at
length, being prevailed upon to remove the obnoxious
understandings, they were passed round the table to be admired, and
eventually returned to their owner, filled with half-and-half,
cigar-ashes, broken pipes, bread-crusts, and gin-and-water. This
was a jocular pleasantry, which only the hilarious mind of a
medical student could have conceived.</p>
<p>As the day of examination approaches, the economy of our friend
undergoes a complete transformation, but in an inverse
entomological progression&mdash;changing from the butterfly into
the chrysalis. He is seldom seen at the hospitals, dividing the
whole of his time between the grinder and his lodgings; taking
innumerable notes at one place, and endeavouring to decipher them
at the other. Those who have called upon him at this trying period
have found him in an old shooting-jacket and slippers, seated at a
table, and surrounded by every book that was ever written upon
every medical subject that was ever discussed, all of which he
appears to be reading at once&mdash;with little pieces of paper
strewn all over the room, covered with strange hieroglyphics and
extraordinary diagrams of chemical decompositions. His brain is
just as full of temporary information as a bad egg is of
sulphuretted hydrogen; and it is a fortunate provision of nature
that the <em>dura mater</em> is of a tough fibrous
texture&mdash;were it not for this safeguard, the whole mass would
undoubtedly go off at once like a too tightly-rammed rocket. He is
conscious of this himself, from the grinding information wherein he
has been taught that the brain has three coverings, in the
following order:&mdash;the <em>dura mater</em>, or Chesterfield
overall; the <em>tunica arachnoidea</em>, or &ldquo;dress coat of
fine Saxony cloth;&rdquo; and, in immediate contact, the <em>pia
mater</em>, or five-and-sixpenny long cloth shirt with linen
wristbands and fronts. This is a brilliant specimen of the helps to
memory which the grinder affords, as splendid in its arrangement as
the topographical methods of calling to mind the course of the
large arteries, which define the abdominal aorta as Cheapside, its
two common iliac branches, as Newgate-street and St. Paul&rsquo;s
Churchyard, and the medio sacralis given off between them, as
Paternoster-row.</p>
<p>Time goes on, bringing the fated hour nearer and nearer; and the
student&rsquo;s assiduity knows no bounds. He reads his subjects
over and over again, to keep them fresh in his memory, like little
boys at school, who try to catch a last bird&rsquo;s-eye glance of
their book before they give it into the usher&rsquo;s hands to say
by heart. He now feels a deep interest in the statistics of the
Hall, and is horrified at hearing that &ldquo;nine men out of
thirteen were sent back last Thursday!&rdquo; The subjects, too,
that they were rejected upon frighten him just as much. One was
plucked upon his anatomy; another, because he could not tell the
difference between a daisy and a chamomile; and a third, after
&ldquo;being in&rdquo; three hours and a quarter, was sent back,
for his inability to explain the process of making malt from
barley,&mdash;an operation, whose final use he so well understands,
although the preparation somewhat bothered him. And thus, funking
at the rejection of a clever man, or marvelling at the success of
an acknowledged fool&mdash;determining to take prussic acid in the
event of being refused&mdash;reading fourteen hours a day&mdash;and
keeping awake by the combined influence of snuff and
coffee&mdash;the student finds his first ordeal approach.</p>
<hr />
<h3>TRUE ECONOMY.</h3>
<p>Peter Borthwick experienced a sad disappointment lately. Having
applied to the City Chamberlain for the situation of Lord
Mayor&rsquo;s fool, he was told that the Corporation, in a true
spirit of economy, had decided upon dividing the duties amongst
themselves. Peter was&mdash;but we were not&mdash;surprised that
between the Aldermen and tom-foolery there should exist</p>

<h3>THE LORD MAYOR&rsquo;S FOOL.</h3>
<p>We are happy in being able to announce that it is the intention
of the new potentate of Guildhall to revive the ancient and
honourable office of &ldquo;Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Fool.&rdquo; A
number of candidates have already offered themselves, whose
qualifications for the situation are so equally balanced, that it
is a matter of no small difficulty to decide amongst them. The
Light of the City has, we understand, called in Gog and
Magog&mdash;Sir Peter Laurie and Alderman Humphrey&mdash;to assist
him in selecting a fit and proper person upon whom to bestow the
Civic cap and bells.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the individuals whose claims are
under consideration:&mdash;</p>
<p><em>The Marquis of Londonderry</em>, who founds his claims upon
the fact of his always creating immense laughter whenever he opens
his mouth.</p>
<p><em>Lord Brougham</em>, who grounds his pretensions upon the
agility displayed by him in his favourite character of &ldquo;the
Political Harlequin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Lord Normanby</em>, upon the peculiar fitness of his
physiognomy to play the Fool in any Court.</p>
<p><em>Daniel O&rsquo;Connell</em>, upon his impudence, and his
offer to fool it in his new scarlet gown and cocked-hat.</p>
<p><em>Peter Borthwick</em>, upon his brilliant wit, which it is
intended shall supersede the Bude Light in the House of
Commons.</p>
<p><em>Colonel Sibthorp</em>, upon his jokes, which have convulsed
all the readers of PUNCH, including himself.</p>
<p><em>George Stephens</em>, upon the immense success of his
tragedy of &ldquo;Martinuzzi,&rdquo; which, to the outrageous
merriment of the audience, turned out to be a farce.</p>
<p><em>T. Wakley</em>, upon the comical way in which he turns his
Cap of Liberty into a <em>Wellington-Wig</em> and back again at the
shortest notice.</p>
<p><em>Sir Francis Burdett</em>, upon the exceeding complacency
with which he wears his own fool&rsquo;s-cap.</p>
<p><em>Ben D&rsquo;Israeli</em>, upon his unadulterated simplicity,
and the unfurnished state of his attic.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Muntz</em>, upon the <em>prim&acirc; facie</em> evidence
that he is a near relative of Gog and Magog, and therefore the best
entitled to the Civic Foolship.</p>
<hr class="full" />
<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S CATECHISM OF GEOGRAPHY.</h2>
<p>The astonishing increase of the great metropolis in every
direction&mdash;the growing up of Brixton and Clapham&mdash;the
discovery of inhabited streets and houses in the <em>terra
incognita</em> to the northward of Pentonville&mdash;and the spirit
of maritime enterprise which the late successful voyages made by
the <em>Bridegroom</em> steam-boat to the coast of Chelsea has
excited in the public mind&mdash;has induced a thirst for
knowledge, and a desire to be acquainted with the exact
geographical position of this habitable world, of which it is
admitted Pinnock&rsquo;s work does not give the remotest idea. To
supply this deficiency, PUNCH begs leave to offer to his friends
and readers <em>his</em> Catechism of Geography, which, if received
with the extraordinary favour it deserves from the public, may be
followed by catechisms on other interesting branches of
knowledge.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<h4>OF THE WORLD IN GENERAL.</h4>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is geography?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> The looking for <em>places</em> on a map, or in
Downing-street, or anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> What do you mean by the world?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Every place comprehended within the circle of a
sixpenny omnibus fare from the Bank.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> Of what is the world composed?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Of bricks and mortar, and Thames water.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> Into how many parts is the world usually
divided?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Into four great parts, viz.&mdash;London,
Westminster, Marylebone, and Finsbury; to which may be added the
Borough, which is over the water. Or it may be said that Fashion
has divided the world into two distinct parts, viz.&mdash;the
East-end and the West-end, and a great number of suburbs.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> How are the bricks and mortar subdivided?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Into continents, islands, peninsulas, and
isthmuses.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is a continent?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Any district containing a number of separate
residences and distinct tenements, as <em>St. James&rsquo;s</em>,
<em>St. Giles&rsquo;s</em>.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is an island?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> An island is anything surrounded by the Thames, as
<em>The Eel-Pie Island</em>, and <em>The Convict Hulk</em> at
Deptford.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is a peninsula?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Anything that runs into the Thames, as <em>The
Suspension Pier at Chelsea</em>, and <em>Jack-in-the-Water</em> at
the Tower-stairs.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is an isthmus?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> A narrow place that joins two continents together,
as <em>Temple bar</em>, which joins <em>Westminster</em> to the
<em>City</em>.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> How is the Thames water divided?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Morally speaking, it is divided into river water,
pipe water, and gin-and-water.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> Where is river water found?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Anywhere between Vauxhall and London Bridges. It is
inhabited principally by flounders and bargemen.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is pipe water?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> An intermitting stream, having its source at some
distant basin. It usually runs into a cistern, until the
water-rates get into arrear, when the supply ceases through the
intervention of a turncock.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> Where is gin-and-water to be found?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> All over the world; but especially in the vicinity
of a cab-stand.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> In what other manner is the Thames water
divided?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Physically speaking, into oceans, seas, gulfs, bays,
straits, lakes and rivers.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is an ocean?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Any great body of water whose limits it is
impossible to describe, as <em>The Floating Bath</em> at
Southwark-bridge, and <em>The Real Tank</em> at the Adelphi
Theatre.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is a sea?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Any small collection of water, as at
Chel<em>sea</em>, Batter<em>sea.</em></p>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is a gulf?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> A gulf is any place, the greater part of which is
surrounded by lawyers, as <em>Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn,&mdash;The Court
of Chancery</em>.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is a haven?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> A commodious harbour, where people lie at anchor in
perfect security, as <em>The Queen&rsquo;s Bench,&mdash;The
Fleet</em>, the sight of which is</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/018-12.png"><img src=
"images/018-12.png" alt=
"Three men in a boat look at a man who is working strenuously in another boat."
id="img018-12" name="img018-12" width="80%" /></a>
<p>ENOUGH TO TURN ONE&rsquo;S HEAD.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is a strait?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> A strait is a narrow passage which connects two
broad principles as <em>Wakley&rsquo;s Straits</em>, which join
Radicalism and Conservatism.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is a lake?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> A lake is any small portion of Honesty, entirely
surrounded by Self, as <em>Peel&rsquo;s Politics</em>.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is a river?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> A river is a Tax-stream which rises from the
Treasury, and runs into the pockets of the Ministerial party. The
People are <em>the source</em> of the stream&mdash;the Ministry is
<em>the mouth</em>. When the mouth is very wide, it is called a
<em>Tory mouth</em>. The <em>right</em> or <em>left</em> banks of a
Tax stream are the <em>Treasury</em> or <em>Opposition
benches</em>, to the right or left of the Speaker when he has his
back to the source.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> How are tax streams divided?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Into <em>salaries</em> and <em>pensions</em>.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> What is <em>a conflux</em>?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Any place where two or more salaries or pensions are
united, as The Duke&rsquo;s breeches-pocket.</p>
<p><em>Q.</em> Is there any other peculiarity attending a tax
stream?</p>
<p><em>A.</em> Yes. <em>Radicalism</em> is that part of a stream
nearest to its <em>source</em>; <em>Toryism</em> that part nearest
to its <em>mouth</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>SPARKS FROM THE FIRE.</h3>
<h4>ALL IS NOT LOST.</h4>
<p>Colonel Sibthorp begs to inform the Editor of Punch that the
loss of the wooden gun named &ldquo;Policy,&rdquo; which was
destroyed by the late fire at the Tower, is not irreparable. He has
himself been for a long time employed by the Tories for a similar
purpose as that for which the &ldquo;Policy&rdquo; had been
successfully used, namely, to make the enemy believe they were well
provided with real artillery; and being now the <em>greatest wooden
gun</em> in the world, he will, immediately on the Lower Armoury
being rebuilt, be happy to take the place of the gun which has been
unfortunately consumed.</p>

<h2>DISTRESS OF THE COUNTRY.</h2>
<h4>BY THE AUTHOR OF &ldquo;LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF LONDON
LIFE.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Merciful Heaven! we shudder as we write! The state of
destitution to which the civic authorities are reduced is
appalling. Will our readers believe it&mdash;there were only five
hundred tureens of turtle, or two thousand five hundred pints, or
<em>five thousand</em> basins, amongst not quite fifteen hundred
guests,&mdash;only two basins and a half a man,&mdash;for the first
course! But we print the bill of fare; it will be read with intense
interest by the manufacturers of Paisley, inhabitants of poor-law
unions, but more especially by the literary community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;GENERAL BILL OF FARE.&mdash;250 tureens of real turtle,
containing five pints each; 200 bottles of sherbet; 6 dishes of
fish; 30 entr&eacute;es; 4 boiled turkeys and oysters; 60 roast
pullets; 60 dishes of fowls; 46 ditto of capons; 50 French pies; 60
pigeon pies; 53 hams (ornamented); 43 tongues; 2 quarters of house
lamb; 2 barons of beef; 3 rounds of beef; 2 stewed rumps of beef;

<p>Apoplexia came down on the Alderman fold,</p>
<p>And his cohorts were gleaming with jaundice like gold,</p>
<p>And the sheen of the spectres that own&rsquo;d his behest</p>
<p>Glimmer&rsquo;d bright as the gas at a new Lord
May&rsquo;r&rsquo;s feast.</p>

<p>Every fiend that humanity shrinks from was there&mdash;</p>
<p>Hepatitis, Lumbago, with hollow-eyed Care,</p>
<p>Hypochondria, and Gout grinning ghastly with pain,</p>
<p>And of Incubi phantoms a horrible train.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And onwards they gallop&rsquo;d in brotherly pairs;</p>
<p>Their pennons pale yellow, their steeds were night mares;</p>
<p>And their leader&rsquo;s grim visage a darksome smile wore</p>
<p>As he gave the word &ldquo;Halt&rdquo; at the Mansion-house
door.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>The vision dismounted, and peering within,</p>
<p>&rsquo;Midst a rattle of glasses and knife and fork din,</p>
<p>His victims beheld, tucking in calipash,</p>
<p>While they hob-nobb&rsquo;d and toasted in Burgundy wash.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Then he straightway amongst them his grisly form cast,</p>
<p>And breathed on each puffing red face as he pass&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>And the eyes of the feasters wax&rsquo;d deadly and chill,</p>
<p>And their stomachs once heaved, and for ever grew still!</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>And the turtle devourers were stretched on the floor&mdash;</p>
<p>Each cheek changed to purple&mdash;so crimson before!</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>And Cripplegate widows are loud in their wail!</p>

since the fire at the Tower he has secluded himself in his own

<h2>A CHAPTER ON POLITICS.</h2>
<div class="note">
<p>WHEREIN &ldquo;PUNCH&rdquo; HINTETH AT A STARTLING CHANGE IN THE
MODUS OPERANDI OF LEGISLATION.&mdash;HE ALSO EXHIBITETH A PROFOUND
KNOWLEDGE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS; AND SHOWETH HOW AT HOME WE ARE ALL
ABROAD.</p>
</div>
<p>At a period when every Englishman, from the Minister to the
Quack Doctor (and extremes very often meet), is laying down his
pseudo-political principles, PUNCH desires to expound his practical
and scientific plan for increasing prosperity and preserving peace.
Yes, at a moment like this, when the party difference
&ldquo;&rsquo;twixt Tweedledum and Tweedledee&rdquo; has produced a
total stand-still; when Whigs cannot move, and when Tories will
not,&mdash;PUNCH steps forward to prescribe (without a fee) for the
sinking Constitution.</p>
<p>PUNCH <em>loquitur</em>.&mdash;A very great genius&mdash;one
almost equal to myself&mdash;has declared that of the great mass of
mankind, ninety-nine out of every hundred are lost in error. Every
day proves the fact.&mdash;From the Peer, who mistakes
exclusiveness for dignity, and a power to injure for a right to
oppress, to the Peasant, who confounds aggression and insolence
with justice and independence, it is all error! error!!
error!!!</p>
<p>Upon this fact rests the basis of my wonderful improvements. If
the majority be wrong, the inference is obvious&mdash;the minority
must be right. Then, in future, let everything be conducted by the
minority&mdash;the sensible few. Behold the consequences!</p>
<p>In those days we shall have Mr. Samuel Carter Hall, who polled
three days and got&mdash;one vote, declared County Member elect.
Sibthorp shall be a man of weight and influence, &ldquo;giving to
(h)airy nothing a local habitation and a name.&rdquo; Roebuck shall
be believed to have had ancestors; and shall wring the nose of some
small boy attached to <em>The Times</em> newspaper; and the
Whigs&mdash;yes, the Whigs&mdash;shall be declared both wise and
honest: though Parliament has pronounced them fools, and the
country has believed them to be knaves.</p>
<p><em>Pupil of Punch, respondet</em>.&mdash;That would be a
change, Punch! Rather. Cast your eye around and see the workings of
this grand principle; the labours of the many compassed by the
few&mdash;steam and slavery.</p>
<p><em>Punch</em>.&mdash;Very true! Let me now draw your attention
to the real difference between the English and some foreign
governments:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Turkish minister generally loses his power and his head at
the same time; the English minister carries on his business without
a head at all. For the performance of his duty the former is
decapitated&mdash;the latter is incapacitated.</p>
<p>The Japanese legislator when disgraced invariably rips up his
bowels; the English legislator is invariably in disgrace, but has
no bowels to rip up. With some other nations the unsuccessful
leader gets bow-stringed and comfortably sown up in a sack; our
great man is satisfied with getting the sack, having previously
bagged as much as lay in his power.</p>

parallels.)</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h2>
<h3>THE WRONG MAN.</h3>
<p>The author of this farce hath placed himself in the first
section of the second chapter of that treatise on &ldquo;Dramatic
Casualties&rdquo; which hath helped to make &ldquo;Punch&rdquo; the
oracle of wit and of wisdom he has become to the entire
intelligence of the land, from the aristocracy
upwards<sup>2</sup><span class="sidenote">2. Punch, No. 11 page
131.</span>. In this instance he is truly one who &ldquo;writeth a
farce or comedy and neglecteth to introduce jokes in the
same.&rdquo; But this we hope will prove a solitary instance of
such neglect; for when he next inditeth, may he show that he is not
the &ldquo;Wrong Man&rdquo; to write a good piece; although alas,
he appeared on Saturday last to be exactly the right man for
penning a bad one.</p>
<p>When a playwright produces a plot whose incidents are just
within the possibilities, and far beyond the probabilities, of this
life, it is said to be &ldquo;ingenious,&rdquo; because of the
crowd of circumstances that are huddled into each scene. According
to this acceptation, the &ldquo;Wrong Man&rdquo; would be a highly
ingenious farce; if that may be called a farce from which the
remotest semblance of faceti&aelig; is scrupulously excluded.
Proceed we, therefore, to an analysis of the fable with becoming
gravity.</p>
<p>At the outset we are introduced to a maiden lady in
(<em>horresco referens!</em>) her private apartment; but to save
scandal, the introduction is not made without company&mdash;there
is also her maid. <em>Patty Smart</em>, although not a new servant,
has chosen that precise moment to inform her mistress concerning
the exact situation of her private circumstances, and the precise
state of her heart. She is in love: it is for <em>Simon Tack</em>
that the flame is kept alive; he, a dapper upholder, upholds her
affections. At this point, a triangular note is produced, which
plainly foretells a dishonourable rival. You are not deceived; it
proposes an assignation in that elysium of bachelors and precipice
of destruction for young ladies, the Albany. Wonderful to relate,
it is from <em>Miss Thomasina Fringe&rsquo;s</em> nephew, <em>Sir
Bryan Beausex</em>. The maiden dame is inconceivably shocked; and
to show her detestation of this indelicate proposal, agrees to
personate <em>Patty</em> and keep the appointment herself, for the
pleasure of inflicting on her nephew a heap of mortification and a
moral lecture. <em>Mr. Tack</em> is the next appearance: being an
upholsterer, of course he has the run of the house, so it is not at
all odd to find him in a maiden lady&rsquo;s boudoir; the more
especially as he enters from behind his natural element&mdash;the
window curtains.</p>
<p>It is astonishing with what pertinacity the characters in most
farces will bore one with their private affairs when they first
appear! In this respect <em>Sir Bryan Beausex</em>, in the next
scene, is quite as bad as <em>Patty</em> was in the former one. He
seems to have invited four unoffending victims to dine at his
chambers in the Albany, on purpose to inform them that in his youth
he was betrothed to a girl whom he has never since seen; but what
that has to do with telling his guests to be off, because he
expects a charming little lady&rsquo;s-maid at six, his companions
are doubtless puzzled to understand. One of them, however, is
<em>Beechwood</em>&mdash;a very considerably diluted edition of
<em>Jerry Bumps</em> in &ldquo;Turning the Tables&rdquo;&mdash;who
determines to revenge this early turn-out by a trick upon the
inhospitable host, and goes off to develop it&mdash;to commence, in
fact, the farce.</p>
<p><em>Sir Bryan Beausex</em> is waiting with impatience the
arrival of <em>Patty</em>, when his servant enters with a letter,
which he says has been just delivered by a servant, who galloped up
to the door on a horse&mdash;an extraordinary clever hack, we
should say; for, to perform this feat, he must have broken through
a porter&rsquo;s lodge, galloped over a smooth pavement, and under
a roof so low, that Lord Burghersh can only traverse it with his
hat off. We should like to see a horse-race in the Albany avenue!
The letter thus so cavalierly brought, contains news of an accident
that has happened to <em>Miss Fringe</em>, and summons
<em>Beausex&rsquo;s</em> immediate presence. Off he goes, and on
comes <em>Beechwood</em> with a &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!, fairly
hoaxed,&rdquo; and all that; which is usually laughed and said by
hoaxers <em>of</em> hoaxees.</p>
<p>It has happened that <em>Mr. Tack</em>, the upholsterer, having
had a peep at the contents of the cocked-hat billet, addressed to
Mistress <em>Smart</em>, conceives a violent fit of jealousy, and
having also <em>Beausex&rsquo;s</em> custom, has the range of his
house as well as that of <em>Miss Fringe</em>. So by this time we
naturally find him behind <em>Sir Bryan&rsquo;s</em>
window-curtains, to witness the interview between him and the
future <em>Mrs. Tack</em>; that is to say, if she prove not
false.</p>
<p>Things approach to a crisis. <em>Miss Fringe</em> enters, but
brings with her <em>Alice</em>, the young lady whose infant heart
was betrothed to <em>Beausex</em>. She, taking the place of
<em>Patty Smart</em>, goes through a dialogue with
<em>Beechwood</em> instead of <em>Beausex</em>; and we now learn
that the former christens the farce, he being the &ldquo;Wrong
Man.&rdquo; Somewhere near this point of the story the first act
ends.</p>
<p>The second act is occupied in clearing up the mistakes which the
audience know all about already; but those among them who had, up
to about the middle of it, been waiting with exemplary patience for
the jokes, began to get tired of having nothing to laugh at, and
hissed. Despite these noisy drawbacks, however, we were able to
find out that <em>Beausex</em> loses his cousin <em>Alice</em> and
her fortune (a regular farce fortune&mdash;some five or six hundred
thousand pounds or so); for she falls in love with
<em>Beechwood</em>, and <em>vice versa</em>. <em>Tack</em> and
<em>Patty Smart</em> are rendered happy; but what really becomes of
<em>Beausex</em> and his aunt the sibilants forbad our knowing. We
suppose, by Mr. Bartley&rsquo;s pantomime, that <em>Sir Bryan</em>
puts up with his hoax and his lady-loss with a good grace; for he
flourished about his never-absent pocket-handkerchief with one
hand, shook hands with <em>Miss Fringe</em> with the other, stepped
forward, did some more dumb show to the dissentients, and, with the
rest of the actors, bowed down the curtain.</p>
<p>We perceive by the Times that the author of the &ldquo;Wrong
Man&rdquo; is not so very culpable after all. He is guiltless of
the plot; that being taken from a French piece called &ldquo;Le
Tapissier.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="full" />
<h3>THE MASONS AND THE STONE JUG.</h3>
<p>Mr. Wakley feelingly remarked at the late meeting of the union
masons that the &ldquo;man who would lock up <em>a pump</em> was
unfit to hold any situation of trust.&rdquo; On the strength of
this opinion the Earl of Waklegrave and Captain Duff intend to
proceed against the Marshal of the Queen&rsquo;s Bench for having
<em>locked them up</em> for these last six months.</p>
<hr />
<h3>&ldquo;THE FORCE OF FANCY COULD NO FURTHER GO.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The Times gives an extract from the <em>Norwich Aurora</em>, an
American paper, descriptive of a newly discovered cavern. The
writer, with a power of imagination almost marvellous, remarks,
&ldquo;The air in the cavern had a peculiar smell,
resembling&mdash;NOTHING.&rdquo; We believe that is the identical
flavour of &ldquo;<em>Leg of Nothing and no
turnips</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<h3>CONUNDRUM BY THE LORD MAYOR.</h3>
<p>Why does a drunken milkmaid resemble a celebrated French
diplomatist?&mdash;Because she is like to

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
